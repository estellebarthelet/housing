# Influence of housing on education, health & happiness

Have you ever wondered where you would be now if you had grown up in a different environment? Would you be healthy? More successful in your studies? Happier?

>*How do your living conditions affect your life?

This is the question we asked ourselves after reading how Mexico managed to improve children's health and their mother's happiness by replacing dirt floors with cement, in a program called [_Piso Firme_] (https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.1.1.75).[1]

Indeed, achieving such results with only a bit more than 150$ of cement per household seemed rather encouraging, but this led us to wonder:

### What, where, who, when ?

To try and answer that vast question we decided to focus on three main research axes.

* Which life outcome (education, health or happiness) is most affected by housing conditions?

* What is the effect of precarious housing on health (both physical and mental) and school involvement for children?

* Are there differences in the effects of precarity between different age groups ? If so, for which outcomes ?

To conduct this study, we opted for a subset of the data from the [National Survey of America's Family] (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/4582) of 2002, to see the perspective from the other side of the frontier, in a similar timeframe as _Piso Firme_ (the program started in 2000). We combined data from children aged 6 to 17 and their respective households.

This dataset recenses a large number of households throughout the USA, providing insight on their demographics and health indicators of the inhabitants.
