# Influence of housing on education, health & happiness

Have you ever wondered where you would be now if you had grown up in a different environment? Would you be healthy? More successful in your studies? Happier?

__*How do your living conditions affect your life?*__

This is the question we asked ourselves after reading how Mexico managed to improve children's health and their mother's happiness by replacing dirt floors with cement, in a program called [_Piso Firme_] (https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.1.1.75).[1]

Indeed, achieving such results with only a bit more than 150$ of cement per household seemed rather encouraging, but this led us to wonder:

## What, where, who, when ?

To try and answer that vast question we decided to focus on three main research axes.

* Which life outcomes (education, health or happiness) is most affected by housing conditions?

* What is the effect of precarious housing on health (both physical and mental) and school involvement for children?

* Are there differences in the effects of precarity between different age groups ? If so, for which outcomes ?

But on who were we going to conduct such a study? We opted for a subset of the data from the [National Survey of America's Family] (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/4582) of 2002, to see the perspective from the other side of the frontier, in a similar timeframe as _Piso Firme_ (the program started in 2000).
